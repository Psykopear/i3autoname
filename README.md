# i3 Workspace Renamer
Program that renames i3 workspaces adding FontAwesome icons of the programs opened in the workspace to the name of the workspace itself.

This is a Rust port of [autoname_workspace.py from justbuchanan](https://github.com/justbuchanan/i3scripts)

# Usage

Download latest release and save it where you want, eg ~/.local/bin/i3autoname

Then run the program when i3 starts. For example add at the end of your `~/.config/i3/config`:
```
exec --no-startup-id "~/.local/bin/i3autoname"
```

# Build

Compile with:
```
cargo build --release
```

The file `src/icons.rs` is a map of appname to fontawesome icons. It is generated by the python script `scripts/generate_icons.py`:

If you want an updated version of the iconset, run:
```
./script/generate_icons.py > src/icons.rs
```

If you want to add some custom icons, modify the script
